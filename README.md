## Features

* Has error matching and shows errors in Annotations section of the Summary.

* Uploads artifact after successful build.

## Inputs

### `path`

Is **not required**. Sets the path to a folder where your fap source code is located if it is not in repository root.

### `channel`

Is **not required**. Sets a channel, from which SDK should be pulled. Can be `dev`, `rc`, `release`. When not specified, defaults to `dev`.

### `lint_only`

Is **not required**. Will only lint your code without building. Can be `true` or `false`. When not specified, defaults to `false`.

## Usage examples

Example of a workflow, that will pull SDK from `rc` channel and build your fap:

```yml
name: Build FAP

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Build
      uses: oleksiikutuzov/flipperzero-ufbt-action@v1
      with:
        channel: rc
```

Example of a workflow, that will pull SDK from default `dev` channel and lint your code located in `lightmeter-fap` directory:
```yml
